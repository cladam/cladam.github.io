## Personal Site & Blog - `cladam.github.io`

This repository contains the source code for my personal website and blog, which is built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub Pages. You can view the live site at [cladam.github.io](https://cladam.github.io).

## About This Project

Every developer needs a home on the web; a space to share ideas, document experiments, and showcase what they’re building. This site is my space. I wanted something clean, content-first, and flexible enough to host both long-form writing and structured documentation for my open-source projects.

## The Technology

The site is built using Jekyll, a static site generator. The theme is a custom one, built from scratch with a clean, content-focused design inspired by the `Lanyon` theme. It features a persistent sidebar for easy navigation and a simple, readable layout for both blog posts and project documentation.

## Still Evolving

This site is a work in progress, and that’s the point. I built it by making small, testable changes and letting each improvement inform the next. That same philosophy, _make it work, make it better_, is what shapes the tools I build and the workflows I advocate for.
