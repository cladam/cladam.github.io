title: About Me
---

I’m Claes Adamsson, an engineering leader with a deep background in DevOps, software delivery, and IT in retail. 
My roots are in XP and Lean Software Development, principles that continue to shape how I work today. 
These foundations, along with influences from DDD, guide me to focus on delivering the right solutions, not just more technology.

Over the years I’ve helped teams improve how they work, from shaping architecture and processes to building tools that make delivery smoother, 
faster, and more valuable. I enjoy working where technology, teams, and business needs intersect. Whether it’s refining a DevOps capability model, 
experimenting with new ways of working, or releasing open-source tools like `tbdflow`, my focus is on enabling sustainable, high-performing delivery.

When I’m not diving into code or delivery metrics, I’m often coaching teams, shaping strategies, or learning from the community.
