title: Why did I build medi?
---

## Where are my files?

I have a bunch of markdown files scattered across my computer, in different repos and folder, and other random temporary spots. It's hard to keep track of them all. It was a frantic dance of `grep`, `find`, and `ls`. It felt like I was fighting the filesystem, `Commande One` helped to a degree but not quite.

I started to think about abstracting away the filesystem and have a central place for my files, like in a lightweight database I could access instantly from anywhere in my terminal?

I had so much fun building [tbdflow](https://cladam.github.io/projects/tbdflow) so I decided to build `medi`.

`medi` is a fast, editor-centric, commandline notes manager I wrote in Rust. It’s my solution to abstracting away the filesystem and creating a focused, high-speed workflow for writing.

### A workflow, not just a folder

The core idea behind `medi` is to stop thinking about files and start thinking about content. I designed it around a few key principles:

  * **CLI-first**: All interaction is through the terminal. It’s fast, scriptable, as qn old Linux user I like pipes...
  * **Editor-centric**: `medi` isn't an editor but it will get you into _your_ favorite editor (`$EDITOR`) with the right content. I use Neo Vim myself: `export EDITOR=nvim`
  * **Local & private**: Your data is yours. It lives on your machine, no cloud component and no spyware, fully OSS.

### Speed is a feature

The biggest win comes from using `sled`, an embedded database written in pure Rust. Instead of scanning a directory, `medi` performs a direct key lookup.

```bash
# This is instantaneous, even with thousands of notes.
medi get "my-old-project-idea"
```

This makes finding and reading notes feel very snappy, which is what you want for a tool you use every day.

### Flexible by design

A good CLI tool should adapt to your needs. `medi new` supports three distinct workflows for creating notes, which has been a game-changer for me.

1.  **Interactively (for long-form writing):**

    ```bash
    medi new "my-next-blog-post"
    # Opens Neovim in a fresh .md buffer
    ```

2.  **With a flag (for quick thoughts):**

    ```bash
    medi new quick-reminder -m "Don't forget to buy milk"
    ```

3.  **From a pipe (for scripting):**

    ```bash
    git log -1 --pretty=format:"%s" | medi new latest-commit-message
    ```

### Version control

Of course, plain text files have one huge advantage: `Git`. I didn’t want to lose the ability to version control my writing.

That’s what the `import` and `export` commands are for. They act as a bridge between the fast `sled` database and the version-controllable world of the filesystem. My workflow is simple: I write and edit in `medi` all week, and then run `medi export ./notes-repo` and commit the changes. It's the speed of a database with the safety of Git.

```
+-----------+      new/edit      +----------------+      export      +------------------+
|           | -----------------> |                | ---------------> |                  |
|   You     |                    |  Sled Database |                  | /notes Directory |

                                                                               |
                                                                               V
                                                                         +-----------+
                                                                         | Git Repo  |
                                                                         +-----------+
```

### Check it out

Building `medi` has been a great learning experience in Rust, and it has genuinely improved my daily workflow. If you’re a command-line enthusiast who deals with a lot of Markdown, I’d love for you to give it a try.

You can find the source code on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/cladam/medi) or install it directly with Cargo:

```bash
cargo install medi
```

The project is still young, and there are plenty of ideas on the roadmap, like adding task management features and full-text search. Check out the README and let me know what you think!

### Real-world usage

This blog entry was written using `medi`,

```bash
medi new medi-blogpost
# writing and then saving for a break, ZZ
medi edit medi-blogpost
# save and close ZZ, or:wq if you like that
medi get medi-blogpost > _posts/2025-08-12-why-medi.md
```
