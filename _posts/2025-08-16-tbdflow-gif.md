title: How I created the demo GIF for tbdflow
---

All projects need a good `README.md`, Itâ€™s the front door to the project and it needs to quickly show a potential user what the tool does and why itâ€™s valuable. I put a lot of effort in having a good `README` for `tbdflow` but it was still static text, and the examples was buried deep down.

After receiving some great feedback I decided I wanted to put the examples on top and create a GIF of the core workflow.

### The goal; a clean, repeatable demo

My first thought was to just use a screen recording tool. The problem with live recording is that itâ€™s hard to get perfect. You make typos, you pause for too long, or you have to resize the window. It can be a bit frustrating.

I wanted a way to create a near-perfect, repeatable demo without the stress of a live performance. The solution? A "tape-driven" terminal recorder.

### Meet `vhs`, the CLI video recorder ðŸ“¼ 

After some research, I landed on [vhs](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs). Itâ€™s a fantastic tool that generates terminal recordings from a simple script file (a `.tape` file). 
This was exactly what I was looking for, DSL's are great! With the script I could,

* **Script the entire session**: I could write out every command, every keystroke, and every pause in advance.
* **Avoid typos**: The demo would be perfect every time.
* **Control the look and feel**: I could set the font size, window dimensions, and even the colour of the window bar to create a nice, clean GIF.

### From script to GIF

1. **Install the tools needed**

  First install `vhs` using their [guidelines](https://github.com/charmbracelet/vhs?tab=readme-ov-file#installation).

2. **Write the "Tape"**

  Next, I created a script file named `commit-demo.tape`. The `vhs` scripting language is simple and intuitive. You just write a series of commands that tell it what to do.

Hereâ€™s a snippet from the script that demonstrates the `tbdflow commit` command:

```bash
# tbdflow-demo.tape

# Set the output file and window properties
Output "commit-demo.gif"
Set FontSize 22
Set Width 1200
Set Height 800
Set WindowBar Colorful

# Create a file to commit
Type "echo 'A new feature' > changes.txt"
Enter
Sleep 1s

# Run the tbdflow commit command
Type 'tbdflow commit -t feat -s auth -m "add password reset endpoint"'
Enter
Sleep 1s

# Answer the DoD checklist
# Use Space to select, Down to move

Type 'tbdflow sync'
Enter
Sleep 5s
```

See the full script at [tbdflow-commit.tape](https://github.com/cladam/tbdflow/blob/main/docs/commit-demo.tape).

3. Generate the GIF
  This was the easiest part. With the script written, all I had to do was run:

```bash
vhs commit-demo.tape
```

`vhs` then automatically opened a terminal, ran my entire scripted demo, and saved the output as a high-quality GIF.


### Conclusion

Using a tool like `vhs` was a amazing. It turned what could have been a frustrating recording session into a simple, repeatable engineering task. It allowed me to create the exact demo I wanted and is a tool I'd highly recommend to anyone looking to create documentation for their own CLI projects.
