### Overview

`choreo` is a test runner and executable Domain-Specific Language (DSL) designed for behavior-driven testing of command-line applications. It brings the power and expressiveness of a BDD framework like Cucumber to the shell, allowing you to write automated, human-readable tests for any command-line tool or system interaction.

The tests are written in a structured, Gherkin-inspired format, making them easy to read and maintain. Each `.chor` file is a self-contained, executable test, eliminating the need for separate "step definition" files.

### Key Features:

* **Human-Readable BDD Syntax:** Utilises a `given-when-then` structure within `test` blocks for clear and descriptive tests.
* **Executable Scripts:** `.chor` files are complete, runnable tests without needing separate "step definition" files.
* **Stateful Scenarios:** Capture variables from command output and reuse them in subsequent steps, allowing for complex, stateful test scenarios.
* **Multi-Actor System:** Interact with and assert against multiple parts of a system in a single test, including a "Terminal" for checking `stdout`, `stderr`, and exit codes, and a "FileSystem" for managing files and directories.
* **Configurable Test Runner:** Provides a settings block to control test behavior such as timeouts and custom shell paths.
* **CI-Friendly Reporting:** Generates standard JSON reports for easy integration with CI/CD pipelines.

### Technologies Used:

* **Rust:** `choreo` is written in Rust, using `pest` for grammar, `protable-pty` for the terminal and `ureq` for HTTP requests. 
* **Gherkin-inspired DSL:** The testing language is inspired by Gherkin, the language used by Cucumber, making it easy to learn and use for those familiar with BDD.
